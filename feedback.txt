Varvara and Egor: website for volunteers and companies that are looking
The project is huge for a hackathon, I wonder how you could do all this in three days. Impressive!
It is divided in front and back-end using react and django. A REST API was created, but not sure for what purprose in the idea.
The code is well structured as it was made by the frameworks, the usage of OOP and database manipulation is also implemented in the models.
It is an impressive project! Congrats!
